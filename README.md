Cloud computing is a key technology in modern software development and deployment. These lab exercises are designed to provide practical experience with popular cloud computing tools and platforms, including:

- **Docker**: For containerization
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For cloud services
- **Minikube**: For local Kubernetes clusters
- **NGINX**: For web server configuration
- **Node.js/Python**: For backend microservices
